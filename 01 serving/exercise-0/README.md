## Setup: Prepare working environment

Knative is currently built on top of both Kubernetes and Istio.
If you want to learn more about Kubernetes or Istio, you can check out the
labs [Kube101](https://github.com/IBM/kube101/tree/master/workshop) and
[Istio101](https://github.com/IBM/istio101/tree/master/workshop).
When you install Knative on IKS, it will install Istio for you
automatically.

### Install kubectl

### Connect to Kubernetes Cluster

### Check the status of Kubernetes Cluster
