## Deploy vnext Version and Apply Traffic Shifting

Did you notice that the Fibonacci sequence started with 1? Most would argue that the sequence should actually start with 0. There's a vnext version of the application at the vnext branch in the github project that starts the sequence with 0 instead of 1. This container image has been built and deployed to dockerhub, and tagged as vnext. We'll deploy that as v2 of our app.

### Deploy vnext
1. Let's deploy vnext, again using a docker image on dockerhub. Maybe we want to slowly roll users over from our old version to the new version, or do some A/B testing of the new version to see what users like better. Let's see what the yaml for this looks like.

    ```
    cat fib-service2.yaml
    ```

    Expected Output:
    ```
    apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
        name: fib-knative
        namespace: default
    spec:
        release:
            revisions: ["fib-knative-xxxxx", "@latest"]
            rolloutPercent: 10
            configuration:
                revisionTemplate:
                    spec:
                        container:
                            image: docker.io/ibmcom/fib-knative:vnext
    ```

	Notice that we've added a rolloutPercent of 10. We've also added our old revision name to the revisions array. Your revision name will be different than `fib-knative-xxxxx`, so you will update this file.

2. Get the name of your first revision.

    ```
    kubectl get revision
    ```

    Expected Output:
    ```
    NAME                SERVICE NAME        GENERATION   READY   REASON
    fib-knative-rgqjl   fib-knative-rgqjl   1            True    
    ```

3. Edit the `fib-service2.yaml` file to change `fib-knative-xxxxx` to your own revision name, which you got from the previous step. In this example, our revision name was `fib-knative-rgqjl`

4. Apply your new configuration to the cluster.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f fib-service2.yaml
    ```

5. Let's run some load against the app, just asking for the first number in the Fibonacci sequence so that we can clearly see which revision is being called.

	```
	while sleep 0.5; do curl "$MY_DOMAIN/1"; done
	```

    Expected Output:
    ```
    [1][1][0][1][1][1][1][1][1][1][1]
    ```
    
6. We should see that the curl requests are routed approximately 90/10 between the two revisions. Let's kill this process using `ctrl + c`.

7. Delete fib-knative service by:

    ```
    kubectl delete -f fib-service.yaml
    ```
